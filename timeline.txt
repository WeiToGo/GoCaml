Note about code gen:

Expressions: most binary and unary op have corresponding instruction in jasmin, except for 
logical || and &&. We use false == 0, true != 0 (apparently on binary level, boolean true is defined as != 0 instead of 1). For now, we are generating 2 labels at the beginning (Label 0 -> false, Label 1 -> true)
