TO DO:

weeder for
- check break + continue statement are properly used. (only within a loop)

for type checking:

can have :
public int m (int m)
{
	int m;
}

function in one scope, parameter in another scope, local var in another scope.


assignment compatibility:
have to be the exact types on both sides.


Utilities:

- a tool to automatically remove the ast crap from the parsesr file will be nice.
        - Don't remove it (obviously.) Write the output to a separate file.

- We need more tests.


++++++++++

fix line numbers [DONE]
fix parser [DONE]
fix semicolon insertion [DONE]
fix ast
fix pretty print

- All valid instead of valid for every single test file
- Have a file with no ending newline and check if the semicolon rule still works
