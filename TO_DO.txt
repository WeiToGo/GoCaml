TO DO:

weeder for
- check break + continue statement are properly used. (only within a loop)

for type checking:

can have :
public int m (int m)
{
	int m;
}

function in one scope, parameter in another scope, local var in another scope.


assignment compatibility:
have to be the exact types on both sides.
